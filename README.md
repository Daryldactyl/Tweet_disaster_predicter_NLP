# Tweet_disaster_predicter_NLP
We look at a number of tweets and predict based on the tweet if it is referencing a disaster or not.

We set a baseline using Naive Bayes
We try multiple models from LSTM RNN layer, GRU, and Bidirectional
We also try Convolutional 1D layers with Pooling layers
Finally we try transfer learning with Google's Universal Sentence Encoder with nontrainable and trainable layers

We predict and visualize test results and consider if some of the training data is mislabeled. 

Finally we consider the Speed/Accuracy tradeoff and reflect whether the accuracy is worth the speed tradeoff from the best performing model and the baseline model.
